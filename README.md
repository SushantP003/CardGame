# 🍎 Memory Card Game

# 📌 Project Description
The **Memory Card Game** is a fun and engaging game where players flip over pairs of fruit-themed cards to find matches. The goal is to match all pairs in the shortest time and with the least number of moves. This game tests memory and concentration while providing an interactive and visually appealing user experience.  

The game is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** with a responsive design and smooth animations. It includes a leaderboard to track top scores based on time and moves.

# ⚙️ How It Works
1. The game board is dynamically generated with a set of fruit-themed cards.
2. The cards are shuffled at the beginning of each game.
3. Players flip two cards at a time:
   - If the cards match, they stay flipped.
   - If they don’t match, they flip back after a short delay.
4. The game ends when all pairs are matched.
5. The time taken and number of moves are tracked and shown at the end.
6. A leaderboard records the best scores based on time and moves.
